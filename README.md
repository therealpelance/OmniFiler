# OmniFiler
A python file utility to move, merge, and copy directories with duplicate identification and removal.

This is a compact file utility for moving, merging, and copying directories.  All operations include identification and removal of duplicate files by file contents rather than file name, so it will find duplicates with different names.

This file utility utilizes tkinter for gui creation.
